This is a quick and dirty PC installer I threw together for the game IO Lander that my friend Anthony Volpe made about 15 years ago.  This installed was itself based on an even older installer I wrote for installing PocketPC apps onto PocketPC devices, so there's some definite hacky-ness here because I wasn't especially worried about maintainability or anything since this was definitely a one-off thing.
