# c-cpp
A repository of C and C++ code

This is some very old C/C++ code I have lying around.  I don't do a ton of C/C++ these days and really haven't for a few years, but I did plenty in the past and I'll post whatever I dig up here.

Note that the triple DES implementation that I wrote from scratch (for some reason I CANNOT fathom now!) also has a JavaScript implementation, for some odd reason I don't remember!

* **omnytex_pc_installer** - a Windows installer system used to install some of my old PocketPC apps
  
* **triple_des** - an implementation of the Triple DES encryption algorithm that I wrote from scratch (for some reason I can't even fathom now!)
